# Simple Store App (CENG114-Project)

The project I did at the end of the semester for CENG 114 (Computer Programming 2) course. In this project, I wrote a program that performs file operations, demonstrating the C skills I learned in the first grade.

The functions and their tasks I created in the project are explained in the comment lines.

The program provides a ready-made data file and operations to be performed with that data upon the user's request.
